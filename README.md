## Lab Overview

The aim of this laboratory is to gain hands-on experience with an important  biomedical signal that can be collected from wearable sensors: The electrocardiogram (ECG). You will learn how to acquire, pre-process and analyse various sensor-based measurements from clinically recorded data. The goal of this lab is to understand the role of signal conditioning, how to choose suitable parameters of signal processing algorithms, and the various technological methodologies biomedical engineers have to understand diseases from wearable sensor data.
